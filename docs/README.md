Baltica enables integrated differential junction usage (DJU)

Baltica provides workflows for quality control and supports three DJU methods, Junctionseq, Majiq, and Leafcutter. Baltica uses _de novo_ transcript assembly to map differently spliced junction to transcripts. The mapping allows us to analyze the global changes in transcription biotype and do further downstream analysis. Our long term aim is to help users systematically prioritize splice-junctions (SJ) for experimental validation.
