### Create and clone the tools
```bash
mkdir analysis
cd analysis
git clone baltica
```

You don't need to clone Baltica for every project. However, computational workflows may be subject to
 changes in different projects, and by having the ability to version control these changes is an advantage.

### Edit the configuration file
```bash
vi Baltica/config.yaml
``` 
See [workflows](workflows.md) documentation for parameters details.

### Run Baltica workflow (locally)
```bash
vi Baltica/config.yaml
``` 

See [cluster](cluster.md) for examples how to run in a computer cluster.
