## Features
    - Snakemake workflows for DJU: `junctionseq`, `majiq`, `rmats`, and `leafcutter`
    - Snakemake workflow for de novo transcriptome annotation with `stringtie`
    - Process, integrate and annotate the results from the methods
    - Summarise AS class of differently spliced junctions
    - DJU method benchmarks
    - Report on the integrative analysis
