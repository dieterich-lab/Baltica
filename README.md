## Features
- Snakemake workflows for DJU: JunctionSeq, Majiq, rMATS, and Leafcutter
- Snakemake workflow for _de novo_ transcriptome annotation with Stringtie
- Process, integrate and annotate the results from the methods  
- Summarise AS class of differently spliced junctions
- DJU method benchmarks 
- Report on the integrative analysis

## Instructions for using Baltica
We tested the instruction below in a computer cluster running Debian Linux distribution and using the Slurm job scheduler. Baltica uses Snakemake and Singularity, which support many different high-performance systems, for instructions on how to use it on different systems, please see 
[Setting up Baltica: long edition](docs/setup.md) or [contact us](https://github.com/dieterich-lab/Baltica/issues),
